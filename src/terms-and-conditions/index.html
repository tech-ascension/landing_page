            <li>
              closing your accounts for all of the services which you use, where Ascension Cloud Solutions PTY LTD has

          <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <h3>Compulsory:</h3>
          <p>
            If a dispute arises out of or relates to the Terms, either party may not commence any Tribunal or Court
            proceedings in relation to the dispute, unless the following clauses have been complied with (except where
            urgent interlocutory relief is sought).
          </p>
          <h3>Notice:</h3>
          <p>
            A party to the Terms claiming a dispute ('Dispute') has arisen under the Terms, must give written notice to
            the other party detailing the nature of the dispute, the desired outcome and the action required to settle
            the Dispute.
          </p>
          <h3>Resolution:</h3>
          <p>On receipt of that notice ('Notice') by that other party, the parties to the Terms ('Parties') must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Within 7 days of the Notice endeavour in good faith to resolve the Dispute expeditiously by negotiation or
              such other means upon which they may mutually agree;
            </li>
            <li>
              If for any reason whatsoever, 14 days after the date of the Notice, the Dispute has not been resolved, the
              Parties must either agree upon selection of a mediator or request that an appropriate mediator be
              appointed by the President of the chosen mediation body or his or her nominee;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Parties are equally liable for the fees and reasonable expenses of a mediator and the cost of the
              venue of the mediation and without limiting the foregoing undertake to pay any amounts requested by the
              mediator as a pre-condition to the mediation commencing. The Parties must each pay their own costs
              associated with the mediation;
            </li>
            <li>The mediation will be held in 10A Avonlea Street Dapto, New South Wales, Australia.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Confidential:</h3>
          <p>
            All communications concerning negotiations made by the Parties arising out of and in connection with this
            dispute resolution clause are confidential and to the extent possible, must be treated as "without
            prejudice" negotiations for the purpose of applicable laws of evidence.
          </p>
          <h3>Termination of Mediation:</h3>
          <p>
            If 7 days have elapsed after the start of a mediation of the Dispute and the Dispute has not been resolved,
            either Party may ask the mediator to terminate the mediation and the mediator must do so.
