Hello

My name is Hiba Rajguru and I am a recent graduate with a Master’s Degree of Information Technology from University of Wollongong (UOW), located in Wollongong New South Wales, Australia.

I am often asked what drew me to technology. I suspect the main reason I am interested in technology is because of the fact that my father would often buy me things. He brought me a computer so I could complete my school projects and play games. It is such small thing, but it truly amazed me. It granted me access to tools that have allowed me to become creative by just using simple programs like Microsoft Word. This was just the start of how my father inspired me to pursue my interests towards becoming a software engineer. I still remember the day he asked me to start learning the fundamentals of HTML. He allocated tasks to me everyday and rewarded me after completing each task to keep me motivated.

From there, it was a just a matter of time I got my diploma and my bachelors degree in Information technology. The Tech industry is going through exponential changes. I believe that taking an early leap of faith into unknown territory can open enormous opportunities. My ability to operate in uncertain circumstances and my curiosity to learn and challenge the status quo have helped me thrive and grow. At some point, I reached that developer's plateau, where I was uncertain about which new technology/skill I wanted to acquire and what direction I was heading, so I tried to start by learning React without a structured syllabus or deadline. It wasn't easy to stay focused and committed to learning every day, so I needed an outlet for accountability and a platform to reinforce my learning.
This journey definitely was not a fairy-tale ride for me. In fact it became more of a roller coaster.

I tried very hard, gave up so many times, pushed through that frustration, cried many times, but in the end I didn’t quit. It was at this point where I started seeing growth within myself. I was learning and growing every day, and I still am. There is famous quote ‘our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall’. Even though technology can be hard to navigate at times, I will dedicate myself to rising up to the challenge even if it may seem daunting to me now.

I am amazed by how tech-related industries are so dominated by men. There are so many great opportunities available for women, and I want to strongly encourage others who have the same desire to push boundaries, be creative, and create impact in joining me in my journey towards securing a role in the tech industry.

Here are some of the things that I have noticed along the way:
• Making a positive impact on my organization/the industry -- for all employees, has been exciting to see. Your efforts are moving the needle of your organization, and I love seeing the quantifiable results of the projects I work on. It helps me grow my professional confidence.
• It’s never boring – seriously, you never run out of things to do! There is so much to learn in tech! You’ll become multitasker as you master the art of working on a project with your coworker while drinking a cup of tea and checking your text messages.
• The perks of working in tech – here are some fantastic benefits of working in tech including compensation rates, career advancements opportunities, the chance of working with people around the world, schedule flexibility and ability to work remotely. At Ascension Cloud Solutions I have been able to have the freedom to work my own hours at home with a great team of knowledgeable software engineers!

If you're just starting out your journey in moving towards a tech-related role, don't get discouraged! As long as you are determined and willing to learn, there is no reason why you can't get to where you want to be.
