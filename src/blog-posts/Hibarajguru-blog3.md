My first Blog
I am Hiba Rajguru and I am a recent graduate in master’s in information technology from university of Wollongong, Wollongong NSW, Australia.  
I suspect the main reason I am interested in technology is that my father would often buy things. He brought me a computer for my school projects and play games. I think that was what amazed me. My ability to become creative by just using Microsoft word made my father decision to incline my interests in towards software engineer, I still remember the day when he asked me to start with introduction to HTML, he allocated me with tasks everyday and also appreciated me with a reward to keep me motivated. From there it was a just a matter of time I got my diploma and my bachelors degree in Information technology.
The Tech industry is going through exponential changes; taking an early leap of faith into unknown territory can open enormous opportunities. My ability to operate in uncertain circumstances and my curiosity to learn and challenge the status quo have helped me thrive and grow. At some point, I reached that developer's plateau, where I was uncertain about which new technology/skill I wanted to acquire and what direction I was heading. So, I tried to start with React but without a structured syllabus and deadlines. It wasn't easy to stay focused and committed to learning every day. I needed an outlet for accountability and a platform to reinforce my learning. 
It was not a fairy-tale ride for me, rather a roller coaster one. I tired very hard, gave up so many times, went through all that frustration, cried many-a-times but didn’t quit. And that was the point I started winning myself, I was learning, I was growing, I still am. There is famous quote ‘our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall’. 
I can think of loads of benefits to being a woman in technology. I would be sharing some of my insights into what it is like being a woman in tech:
	•	Making a positive impact on my organization/the industry -- for all employees, its exciting to see your efforts are moving the needle of your organization, I love seeing the quantifiable results of the projects I work on. It helps me grow my professional confidence.
	•	It’s never boring – seriously, you never run out of things to do! You’ll become multitasker as you master the art of working on a project with your coworker while drinking a cup of tea and checking your text messages.
	•	The perks of working in tech – here are some fantastic benefits of working in tech including compensation rates, career advancements opportunities, the chance of working with people around the world, schedule flexibility and ability to work remotely.
