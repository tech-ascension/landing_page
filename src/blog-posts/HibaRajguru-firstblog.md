Hello!

My name is Hiba Rajguru, and I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Information Technology from the University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.

People often ask me what sparked my interest in technology. The answer is simple: my father. As a child, he would often buy me gadgets, including a computer that opened up a world of creative possibilities for me through basic programs like Microsoft Word. He also encouraged and supported me in my journey towards becoming a software engineer, tasking me with learning new skills and rewarding me for completing them. This eventually led to my obtaining a diploma and bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

The tech industry appeals to me because of its constant evolution and opportunities for taking risks and challenging the status quo. However, the journey has not always been easy. I have faced challenges in staying focused and motivated while learning new skills, but I did not give up. My belief is that our greatest achievement is not in never falling but in rising every time we do, and I am committed to continuing to grow and learn in this field.

I also want to address the male-dominated nature of the tech industry and encourage more women to join me in this journey. The benefits of working in tech are numerous, including competitive compensation, career advancement opportunities, the chance to work with people from all over the world, flexible schedules, and the option to work remotely.

If you're just starting out on your tech journey, don't be discouraged. As long as you're determined and willing to learn, you can reach your goals. I hope my experiences and insights can provide encouragement and inspiration for your own tech journey.
